        "In today’s digitized modern world, the popularity of food apps is increasing due to their functionality to view, book, and order food with a few clicks on the phone for their favorite restaurant or cafes, by surveying the user ratings and reviews of the previously visited customers. The objective of the project is to analyze the dataset and make appropriate strategic decisions. The problem statement here asks us to cluster the restaurants to help customers find the best restaurants in their city and according to their taste and understand the fields they are lagging in. This will help Zomato in building a good recommendation system for their customers. Building a sentiment analysis model to understand the view of customer towards a restaurant and to identify the industry critics and especially work on their reviews to build a reputation worth praising."

        "With various visualization techniques, we got to understand the relationship of different features. We found out expensive restaurants, high and low rated restaurants, cost of low rated restaurants, cuisines, critics with most followers. Clustering of dataset is done using Kmeans clustering. Dataset is clustered into five clusters according to cost, ratings and cuisines. Sentiment analysis was done to classify the words and phrases to predict the mood of the customers and to work on the reviews. For model prediction, sentiment is used as dependent variable Various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN and SVM were used to fit the data. Classification report of train and test set gave insight into the model performance. Confusion matrix showed the false positive and false negative part. SVM showed the least number of false positive, which means this model wrongly predicted a negative review as positive."
